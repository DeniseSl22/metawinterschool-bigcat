This workshop consists of a part about identifier mapping (BridgeDb) and pathway analysis (WikiPathways and PathVisio).

# Identifier Mapping

## BridgeDb

[BridgeDb](https://www.bridgedb.org/) is a project, an application programming interface (API),
a Java library, a webservice, a collection of identifier mapping database, and more (see doi:[10.1186/1471-2105-11-5](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-11-5)).

In this practical you will use BridgeDb to modify identifier mappings.
